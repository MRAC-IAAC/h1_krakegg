# h1_krakegg

Krakegg is a soft robotics project exploring the implementation of bionic actuation for soft robotics grippers.

The repository contains the files, code & hardware components used in the project.

In the documents, you will find:

**A. Text instructions:**

0.Concept & process: explaining the overall process leading to the development of the final prototype for the soft robotics gripper.

0_01: Bill of materials: a list of the materials used for the production of the final prototype, with affiliated links to similar products that can be purchased from Amazon/ local retailers.

0_02: Build process: documenting the steps taken in order to build the final prototype

**B. 3D printing files:**

Structure : Print files for the air chamber, exoskeleton, and connection to the robot

Moulds : Print file for the silicone moulds for the fingers and knuckle spacer

**C. Circuit:**

03_circuit: Circuit diagrams for the communication and control circuit

03_arduino: Arduino code for the air control circuit
